                <h3 class="center">Bio pages have always seemed weird to me. What professional information does an employer gain from a bio paragraph that she can’t glean from a resume? In any case here ARE a couple things you might miss from my resume. Let the bragging commence!</h3>
                <p><i>An excerp from my college application essay; see, bragging.</i> Over the summer breaks, beginning with 3rd grade, instead of spending time outside or playing video games, my dad decided that I would continue learning. Things started with worksheets of math drills, before graduating to Stanford’s online learning tool called ALEKS, and then Khan Academy’s tutorial videos and completing advanced math. This was required every day of summer. While I really hated doing it then, it has made me stronger at math and has trained me to solve problems quickly. Eventually it became routine. 

As 7th grade ended, I chose to enroll in a Iowa State University’s OPPTAG summer program. At OPPTAG, the dedication to studying was more rigorous than it was at home - nearly 7 hours of college level computer science each day. This was quite easily the most difficult academic exposure I had ever had. The next summer’s OPPTAG program was just as unrelenting: physics at a college level, college textbooks, and a college professor. Once again, I felt completely out of my depth. During 9th grade summer while taking a OPPTAG chemistry course, I realized that I had acclimated to the teaching style and rigors of college courses. Even though my class consisted mostly of high school seniors, I completed the course with the third highest score.

During the summer after 10th grade, while interning with a computer hardware team, I found that what I enjoyed most was learning. I studied servers and networks during the workday. At home, I taught myself - with my dad’s help - SQL Server. As I went into 11th grade and beyond, the desire for new knowledge, especially in the field of computer science, continued to grow. While I do watch T.V., by and large, the topics are news, politics, and science. And while I enjoy playing video games again, or spending time with friends, camping, wakeboarding, and working toward my Eagle Scout, my true passion is putting learning and creativity into action.

The I.T. staff at my high school asked me to help solve many of their computer issues, giving me opportunities to problem solve individually and as a part of a team. I spend some of my free periods in the engineering room, designing and building acoustic speakers, longboards, and an all metal frame backpack. Others are spent in the computer science room, working with the teacher on programming scenarios or assisting other students with their own learning. In addition to structured classes I take in high school or summer camp, I also embrace other learning opportunities that present themselves and I attempt all challenges so that I can gain new experience.
